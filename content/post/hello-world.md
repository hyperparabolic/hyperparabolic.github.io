Welcome to blog.decent.id!

## About this website

My online presence has been shrinking almost entirely to private spaces. I decided I wanted to fix that by making a personal website.


### What's going to live here?

I haven't decided what all I'll post here yet.

I have a huge amount of notes from various projects over the past year. I definitely want to take some of those notes and convert them into blog posts here. Partially just so that I have a better place to keep notes, and partially because maybe somebody else will find them useful. Most of these are probably going to be about converting my home lab over to [NixOS](https://nixos.org/) (my config is [open source on github!](https://github.com/hyperparabolic/nix-config)). Some of these are about code I've written that I do not own, primarily doing identity related consulting / contracting work.

I also feel like I have a lot of projects that don't quite get finished, and I want a place to document those and to have a better place to organize those to hopefully get better at revisiting them.

There might be some other things. I'm obsessed with playing fingerstyle guitar and have starting transcribing some of my own tabs. Some of those or some practice videos might make it on here.

I might even just make some blog posts.  IDK.

This page is also [open source on GitHub](https://github.com/hyperparabolic/hyperparabolic.github.io). If I like you I might even let you make a guest post if you open a PR there.

### What's in a name?

decent.id isn't anyting special.  decent.id is a domain I bought that I use for issuing LetsEncrypt certificates to hosts that are routable on my internal network. That will probably be a blog post soon enough!

## Signing off

If any of this sounds neat, be sure to check back soon.

Let me know if you have a webring you think this might fit into.
