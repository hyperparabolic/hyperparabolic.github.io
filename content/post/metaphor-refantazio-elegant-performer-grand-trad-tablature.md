> What a beautiful melody... As I listened to the performance, I thought about all I'd seen...

A quick little tab. In the game Metaphor: ReFantazio, there's a tavern bard named the Elegant Performer. If you talk to him he asks you about what city has left the largest impression on you, and if you answer Grand Trad, he plays a solo guitar variation of Grand Trad's Night Theme.

## A dreamy little loop

Metaphor: ReFrantazio is Atlus's latest mainline JRPG release. It's mechanically similar to the Persona series, but it's mostly a departure from the standing Megami Tensei universe. It's instead based in a vaguely European fantasy setting inhabited by diverse tribes and factions. The church, the secularists, and the royal loyalists are all in conflict over succession after the King is murdered. I'm nowhere near finished, but it's a pulpy story that's kept me coming back as I've slowly worked through it.

The music is a bit unique from any other MT series I've seen. Almost all of it is orchestral, sometimes featuring operatic or chanted esperanto vocals. I doubt it'll have quite as much staying power as the jazzy Persona series sountracks for me, but there have been a few tracks I've enjoyed a lot. One of them is Grand Trad's Night Theme, and when I heard the Elegant Performer's rendition I knew I needed to take a minute to play and transcribe it.
