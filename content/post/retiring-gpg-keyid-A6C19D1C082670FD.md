KEYID A6C19D1C082670FD will be retired soon. I haven't been using any public key servers, so this seems like the most appropriate place to post a rotation notification.

Old key hasn't been leaked or misused. I'm still using it temporarily personally until I'm sure everything is completely settled.

I finally retired my last Yubikey 4, and have moved everything to ed25519 / cv25519 keys. Everything is supportin KDF now too, so that's a nice bonus.

New public key is over in the sidebar if you need it (key icon) -->
