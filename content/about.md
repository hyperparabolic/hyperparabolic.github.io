Hey! I'm Spencer.

## About me

- I grew up in Ohio, went to Ohio State University, moved around a lot, but am currently settled in Chicago.
- I love hiking and skiing. Cycling has been my replacement since moving to the city.
- I'm obsessed with fingerstyle guitar, and especially playing polyphonic music on guitar.
- I used to stream on Twitch in another time and place in my life. I'm a platforming video game aficionado. I've beaten dozens of [Kaizo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaizo) Super Mario World rom hacks, and have all of the achievements unlocked in Celeste.

## Career

- I'm currently self employed doing identity consulting and contracting.
- I worked on Pocket at [Mozilla](https://mozilla.org).
- I led an engineering team and wrote a lot of code at [TraitWare](https://traitware.com/).
- I worked on Jabber and Webex Teams at [Cisco](https://www.cisco.com/).
- I worked on speech recogniation and language modeling at [Think-A-Move](https://think-a-move.com/#).

## Contact

I haven't made a catch-all email or a contact form yet. If the socials in the aside don't work for you, you could always [open a GitHub Issue in this repo](https://github.com/hyperparabolic/hyperparabolic.github.io/issues) to get a hold of me in a pinch.
